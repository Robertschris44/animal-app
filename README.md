# News Buddy

We created an app where users can search current top news articles and stories from the New York Times. With the overwhelming majority of news stories recently having a negative impact on our stress levels and mental health in general, our app provides a little levity by inviting users to "click" to *retrieve* a News Buddy - a.k.a a random doggo (img) - that will help bring that seratonin and hopefully a smile to our users faces.

Users can see and *retrieve* their previous article searches for future reference. 

We used HTML, Tailwindcss, JavaScript to dynamically add elements and interact with the APIs. 

# Future features

For News Articles:
1) Articles display in a prominent gallery that scrolls on left or right arrow click

2) Add Sortable & Droppable features: "Multiple Containers" and "Transformed" to save articles in a gallery

3) Add category dropdown plus searchable input to access more stories.

For Buddy Feature:
1) Add unique quotes for each News Buddy

2) Generate glorious name and allow user to accept or create their own

3) Create a timer function where Buddy retrieves a random story suggested for user from a positive perspective.
